				<p>The Wii has to be one of the most innovative and successful video game consoles ever. The Wii feature brand new oddly shaped Wii-motes that would be used to play games in a whole new way with motion controls. The Wii's less conventional controller and Motion controls made the console more accessible to people, which made it the best sell Nintendo console to date. The Wii was also designed to be small and minimalistic in order to increase the console's audience. However, this feature actually severed as a hindrance and restricted the console's power and graphics. Besides this the console is a real embodiment of the innovation and forward thinking of Nintendo. Of course with all of these new motion controls came interesting twists on classic franchises and a whole new brand of motion control based games.</p>

This game is great for any level of gamer and no mater your age or experience, you will love this game.</p>

				<p>Super Paper Mario is a great game for someone who wants to play RPG but does not want to deal with all of the confusing mechanics. The story of the game is that one day, and the Evil Count Blec decided  that he was going to use the power of chaos to destroy the universe and rebuild his own. Therefore Mario must journey to find the 7 pure hearts in order to destroy the chaos. This game is a far departure from traditionally Mario games. The game has some of the crazies scenarios and worlds, including a part in which you have to play a Dating Simulator and a world which is basically Heaven and Hell.</p>

				<p>Wii play is a party(-ish) game that focuses on mini-games that utilize the motion controls of the Wii. The game is for two players and includes games based on favorites, such as Duck Hunt and Tanks, and some brand new ones, such as Find Mii. This game is pretty basic and almost all of the mini-games are fun and light, while still being extremely competitive. (Note: it does have a weird bobble game that is horrible).</p>

				<h4>M&#38;M's Kart Racing</h4>
				<div class="infoBox">
					<div class="infoImg">
						<img src="images/mamracing.png" alt="M&#38;M Racing" class="gameimg">
					</div>
					<ul class="infoText">
						<li>Relased: October 25, 2007</li>
						<li>Sales:</li>
						<li>Rating: 2/10</li>
						<li>Genere: Racing</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>M&#38;M Racing is a poor excuse for a kart racer. The game play for this game does a terrible job of utilizing the motion controls, making the game hard to even play. The cart designs are atrocious and the courses are hard to navigate, mainly because of the poor controls. Even the power-ups in this game are hindrances, as using them actually slows you down because you will almost always crash into the sides of the coarse. Also, the SFX of the game are painful to hear as one character will constantly exclaim “Approaching sound barrier” every time he speeds up. Avoid this game at all costs.</p>

						<li>Genere: Action-adventure</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Considered one of the best installments in the Zelda franchise, Twilight Princess had sold the most copies out of any Zelda game before Breath of the Wild. This game has received several awards and is critically acclaimed to be one of the best games ever. The game features fairly realistic graphics and rather challenging puzzles and dungeons. This game is recommended for all Zelda fans and those who want to experience a quality RPG.</p>
