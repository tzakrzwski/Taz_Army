				<p>The SNES was second home console that Nintendo released and while looking very similar to the NES it was in truth very different. The SNES was much more powerful than its predecessor, allowing for better graphics (even some early 3D were released) and more advanced games. Also, controller was updated to include to extra gamepad buttons and shoulder buttons, but of which have become common mainstream controllers. The games are the real feature of the Super NES as many franchises were developed and flourished on the more powerful system. Overall, the SNES was not as innovative as the Wii or Switch, but it did allow Nintendo to improve their games and game-play to a new level.</p>
