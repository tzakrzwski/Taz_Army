			<h2><span>Our Mission</span></h2>
			
			<p class="mission">TAZ&#39;s Army is a site dedicated to informing the world about the some of the best games created for the consoles of the big player in the video game market, Nintendo. Nintendo has been creating great games and consoles for decades, and here we believe that people should know about these stellar properties. (We are also not sponsored by Nintendo or any of the listed games creators.)</p>

			<h2><span>Collaborators</span></h2>
			
			<p class="mission">I want to give a special thanks to eveyone who helpped with reviews and design of the site. Without you, this site would not be what it is today.</p>
			<p class="thanks"><b>Thanks to THDawg, ZichaelMakrzwsk, Mazthemaster, and ChachuRabon</b></p>

			<h2><span>FAQ</span></h2>
		<section id="faq">
			
			<p class="q"><b>How old is this site?</b></p>
			<p class="a">Currently, this site is brand-new and as of writing this has just relased</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>How often is the site updated?</b></p>
			<p class="a">It depends on the console. For the older consoles, like the NES and SNES, not very often, maybe once a year. For the newer consoles, like the Switch and DS, game sales data should be updated once or twice a month and new tiles will be added as they are relased.</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>I don&#39;t see my favorite game listed. How do I suggest new games?</b></p>
			<p class="a">If you don&#39;t see a game that you love, you can send your suggestion. In your suggestion, please include the games title, the console it was original released on, and any other information about the game that you wanted listed in its description.</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>How often are new games added?</b></p>
			<p class="a">It depends on the console, the number of suggestions recived and the number of new games relased for the console.</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>Why are not all of Nentendo&#39;s main stream consoles (such as the Gamecube and N64) not listed?</b></p>
			<p class="a">Because this site is new (and I currently doing most of the work by myself), it was just to much work to add these sites. In the future, we hope to add these and other sites to include the great titles from these and more Nintendo consoles.</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>I am looking for a specfic game / franchise. Is there a way to search for it?</b></p>
			<p class="a">If you are looking for a frachise or a specific game, all games are listed under the Game Index game.</p><br>

			<p class="q"><b>Are Non-nentendo games featured on this site?</b></p>
			<p class="a">Most games on this site are connected to Nintendo in some form, but not all games are produced and developed completely by Nintendo. Maybe in the future the site will include more third-party games, but mostly Nintendo for now.</p><br>
