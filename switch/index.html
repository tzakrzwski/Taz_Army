				<p>The Switch is Nintendo's current flagship console. The Switch builds on Nintendo's other advancements, leading to a hybrid home and portable console. The Switch itself is a tablet looking device that can have joy-con remotes attached to both sides in order to create a portable game pad. The console can also be docked and the remotes removed to play on the big screen. All in all, the Switch takes the technology of the DS, the Wii, and Wii U and combines them. At the current time, the catalog for the Switch is not very large, mainly because of its recent release. However, the games that are currently released for the console, especially the first-party ones, are some of the best that the market has to offer and will most definitely become classics in the years to come.</p>
