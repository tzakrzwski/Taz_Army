				<p>The Wii U the eight generation console for Nintendo that was essential a failure, having the lowest sales of all Nintendo home consoles. However, while the machine did not sell well, it did add new innovative features, such as a gamepad controller, which although it was poorly designed / implemented, did add something new. Also, the Wii U is the first Nintendo console to feature HD graphics and provides almost complete backwards compatibility with the Wii. The main attraction of any console thought is its games, which the Wii U also fell behind in because of developers not knowing how to properly implement the gamepad. Even with poor third party support, the Wii U still featured a good bit of 1st party high quality games that made the console worth playing.</p>
